## Story

Kapo is a forest ranger who has gone mad because he believes the forest is speaking to him.

According to him, there is something ancient buried beneath the oldest root in the forest—a presence that has been asleep for centuries.

Every night, he hears whispers among the trees and feels the presence of several spirits.

To break this curse, he comes up with the idea of lighting a bonfire that will burn away the presence causing these visions and his madness.
